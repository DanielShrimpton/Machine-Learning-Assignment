# Machine Learning Assignment

## Specification

This assignment asked us to compare two different machine learning models made to predict student's 
final grades using the OULAD. We then have to write up a scientific report detailing the 
procedure. This is stored in 
[report.pdf](https://github.com/DanielShrimpton/Machine-Learning-Assignment/blob/master/Report.pdf) 
and the source code is in `classifier.py` which also uses some common code from `Class.py` which 
is a file containing a custom class to handle repeated actions I performed with pandas and 
processing data.

## Modules

Using SkLearn for all algorithms and pandas for data structure.

Needs `Class.py` to run as this contains useful functions and data structures for the data.
